# Data Consistency Fix Documentation

## Issue Summary
Table 5.1 contained mathematically inconsistent domestic violence statistics that violated basic statistical principles.

## Problem Identified
- **Urban domestic violence rate**: 23.7%
- **Rural domestic violence rate**: 31.2%  
- **Incorrect overall rate**: 28.4% ❌
- **Correct overall rate**: 27.5% ✅

## Mathematical Analysis
The overall rate must be calculated as a weighted average:
```
Total Rate = (Urban Rate × Urban Weight) + (Rural Rate × Rural Weight)
```

Using the sample proportions:
- Urban weight: 49.7% (5,230 / 10,517)
- Rural weight: 50.3% (5,287 / 10,517)
- Correct total: 23.7% × 49.7% + 31.2% × 50.3% = 27.5%

## Changes Made

### 1. Added New Table 5.1
Created a descriptive statistics table showing:
- Regional breakdown of domestic violence rates
- Sample sizes and proportions
- Mathematically consistent weighted average

### 2. Fixed Sample Size Arithmetic
- Corrected total sample sizes to match urban + rural sums
- Updated 10,519 → 10,517 and 10,867 → 10,864

### 3. Renumbered Tables
- Previous Table 5.1 → Table 5.2
- Previous Table 5.2 → Table 5.3
- And so on...

### 4. Added Validation
- Created `data_validation.py` script
- Validates mathematical consistency
- Can detect similar errors in future data

## Usage of Validation Script

```bash
python3 data_validation.py
```

**Sample Output:**
```
=== Domestic Violence Statistics Validation ===

Testing CORRECTED Table 5.1 data:
Urban rate: 23.7%
Rural rate: 31.2%
Urban weight: 0.497 (49.7%)
Rural weight: 0.503 (50.3%)
Claimed total: 27.5%

Validation Results:
Weights sum to 1.0: True (sum = 1.000)
Calculated total: 27.5%
Difference from claimed: 0.0 percentage points
Total is valid: True
Overall consistency: ✓ PASS
```

## Prevention of Future Issues

1. **Always validate weighted averages** using the validation script
2. **Check that sample sizes add up correctly**
3. **Ensure population weights sum to 100%**
4. **Verify all calculations follow statistical principles**

## Academic Integrity
This fix ensures compliance with basic mathematical and statistical principles, addressing the academic integrity concerns raised in issue #288.
